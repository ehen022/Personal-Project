this project is my past work on the unit FIT3139: Computational science and Modelling and it showcases the ability of
taking an existing deterministic model and further extending it so that it showcases a more complicated model. 
furthermore, this project also done an analysis on discrete time and continious time. for my extension of this existing SIR model, i chosed it so that
it can account vaccination rate so that it could show a better understanding on this epidemic spread. on the analysis i provided, 
i listed a bunch of assumption on this project to minimizes unwanted factor and the reason for each assumption is explained. 

After listing all the assumption, i then uses analyses the newly extended model on continious and discrete time while breaking down the 
main question listed in question 1 by introducing a smaller sub-problem. by answering question 2 and 3, we get a better understanding on
the problem the main question poses. furthermore on both of these number we put the model under few different condition and compare the 
two analysis to find further differences. 

In the fourth question, we done a steady state analysis to find the breakpoint of the model and we find out whether this model has a steady state or not.
by doing this, we get a better idea until what day can we expect the lifecycle of an epidemic outbreak and it is also to test whether the model is functioning
as intended.
